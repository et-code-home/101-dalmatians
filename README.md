# 101 Dalmatians: Master Array Methods in JavaScript

Calling all JavaScript learners! Unleash your inner data whiz by practicing essential array methods with this fun and unique project.

## Activity Details

### The Data

Embark on an adventure with the 101 Dalmatians! Each dog in the `data.js` file is represented as an object with the following structure:

```js
const dalmatianObject = {
  name: "Lucky",
  age: 2,
  spots: 69,
  height: 24,
  weight: 54
}
```

The `dogs` array in this file contains many of these dalmatian objects.

### The Exercises

There are 22 exercises that prompt you to use different array methods to extract specific details from our dalmatian data. Depending on your current understanding of JS array methods and how you learn most effectively, you can either:

- **Start with structured practice:** Begin your mastery in [sorted.js](./sorted.js), where problems are categorized by `.map()`, `.reduce()`, `.filter()`, and `.forEach()`. This guided approach solidifies your understanding of each method's purpose and usage.
- **Level up with a randomized challenge:** Ready for more of a challenge? Dive into [random.js](./random.js) where the same problems are presented in a mixed order, testing your adaptability and problem-solving using the right methods.

### Stretch Goals

If you finish all of the provided exercises, challenge yourself by:

- Re-solving problems with different methods to explore various approaches and deepen your understanding.
- Inventing your own array method challenges using the Dalmatian data. Get creative and explore advanced techniques!

This project serves as a springboard for your array method mastery. Keep practicing, experiment, and enjoy the journey of becoming a confident JavaScript developer!
