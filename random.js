/*
Random Problem Set for Array Methods Practice

This file presents a collection of JavaScript coding challenges specifically designed to reinforce proficiency in using the following array methods:

- Array.map()
- Array.reduce()
- Array.filter()
- Array.forEach()

The problems cover a range of common array manipulation tasks, providing comprehensive practice. The problems are identical to those in 'sorted.js', but they are presented in a random order, encouraging adaptability and problem-solving skills.

Instructions:

1. Carefully read each problem statement.
2. Implement the required solution using the most appropriate array method(s).
3. Test your solutions thoroughly for correctness and efficiency.

Additional Tips:

- Refer to JavaScript documentation or online resources if needed for further clarification on array methods.
- Consider using debugging tools to step through your code or `console.log()` statements to identify any issues.
- Embrace the challenge and enjoy the process of learning and mastering these essential JavaScript tools!

// This line imports the dogs array from `data.js`. You don't need to do anything with it :)
const dogs = require('./data')

// Console.log() the name of each dog

// Create an array of all the dog names

// Create an array of dogs who are more than 15 inches tall

// Create an array of dogs whose names start with "R" or "S"

// How many spots do all the dogs have between them?

// Create an array of dogs who are more than 12 inches tall

// Create an array of all the dog names in lowercase

// How much do all the dogs weigh, in total?

// Create an array of the dogs' ages in dog years (One human year is equal to seven "dog years")

// How many inches tall are all of the dogs combined?

// Create an array of dogs who are three years old or younger

// Create an array of dogs whose heights are 15 to 18 inches (inclusive)

// It costs one dollar per letter to print name tags for the dogs. How many dollars will it cost to print tags for every dog?

// Create an array of dogs who have fewer than ten spots

// What is the total of all the dogs' ages (in human years)?

// Create an array of dogs who have exactly one spot

// Create an array of all the dog names spelled backwards

// Add a "gender" property to each dog in the original array and randomly assign "male", "female", "nonbinary" or "other"

// Create an array of all the dog names in uppercase

// Create an array of dogs whose names start with a "P"

// Create an array of dogs whose weights are 20 to 30 pounds (inclusive)

// Console.log() "<dog> is a good boy/girl!" for each dog based on the gender property you added earlier
